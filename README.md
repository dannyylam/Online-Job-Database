# Online-Job-Database
Using Python, I created an online job listing database. The actual database is not actually online or uses any API's.
I used the tkinter package to build to project's GUI application. 
You can add, update, and delete job listings from the database file. 
The database's columns include JobID, Position, Company, Location, Experience, and Salary.

I really enjoyed working on this project because I got to use the knowledge I learned to use.
Designing the GUI and applying code to labels and buttons were very fun. 
I hope to do more projects like this in the future, but more advanced of course.
